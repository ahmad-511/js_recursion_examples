# "Real Life Javascript Recursion Examples"

âœ… [Check out Dave Gray's YouTube Channel with all of my tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/DaveGrayTeachesCode).

**Description:**

Finding examples of recursion that are applicable to real-life coding situations and not just math problems can be difficult. Using Javascript, this tutorial introduces the concept of recursion and provides both standard and real-life examples for you to learn from.

I suggest completing Dave Gray's [8 hour JavaScript course tutorial video](https://youtu.be/EfAl9bwzVZk) if you are new to Javascript.

**My Modifications:**
- I added `buildTree` example to rebuild the same `artistsByGenre` object structure from a parent-child table
